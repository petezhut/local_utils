        Given a configuration file: test.cfg
        When the configuration file is loaded no errors are thrown
        Then the sections should be: TYPES,DEFAULT,test,testnames

    Scenario Outline: Show that the following Section/Key pairs match the file
        Given a configuration file: test.cfg
        When the configuration file is loaded no errors are thrown
        Then <section>, should have a key: <key> which equals: <value>
        Examples:
            | section   | key       | value             |

            | test      | b         | 2                 |
            | testnames | t1        | This is a test    |
